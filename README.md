## Controls

<kbd> <br> Space <br> </kbd>  --->  Pause simulation

<kbd> <br> 6 (or -) <br> </kbd>  --->  Dezoom

<kbd> <br> = (or +) <br> </kbd>  --->  Zoom

<kbd> <br> Directional arrows <br> </kbd>  --->  Move across the map

## Note

The final project was a full game with a GUI for the launcher, more controls, settings etc

But I decided that I'll do later but I still could upload it !

And please be kind with the performances... I know my algorithm is not optimal and the way I've coded it is really not the best to reach more FPS
